# .NET Developer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The site showcases my experience as a .NET developer and provides a place to highlight my projects and contact information. It features animated background gradients and modern glassmorphism styling for a sleek, attractive look.
